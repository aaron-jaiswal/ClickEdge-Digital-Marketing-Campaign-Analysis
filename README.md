## Business Recommendations

1. Focus on Campaign Quality Over Impressions: Since higher impressions do not necessarily lead to better ROI, prioritize quality audience targeting and engagement strategies over simply increasing impressions. Invest in refining campaign messaging and personalization to drive better returns.

2. Optimize Cost Per Click (CPC) Investments: Higher CPC does not guarantee better click-through rates, suggesting the need to evaluate the effectiveness of ads beyond just spending. Consider testing different ad creatives, targeting methods, and copy to boost CTR without significantly raising costs.

3. Monitor and Adapt to Conversion Rate Trends: Conversion rates vary significantly over time, so regular monitoring is essential. Investigate potential external factors like seasonality or competition and adjust campaigns accordingly. Consider refreshing ads, offers, or targeting strategies when conversion rates begin to dip to maintain consistent performance.
