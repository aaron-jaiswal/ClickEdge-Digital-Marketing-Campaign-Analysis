## Background

ClickEdge.ai, a leading provider of AI-driven marketing tools, empowers businesses to optimize campaigns and enhance customer engagement. The company offers multiple subscription tiers tailored to businesses of all sizes, from startups to enterprise clients. This project explores performance metrics across marketing channels, loyalty programs, customer retention, and refund trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights to maximize revenue, improve customer experience, and guide strategic investments.

## Executive Summary

An in-depth analysis of ClickEdge.ai’s marketing performance from 2019 to 2022 reveals key trends in subscription sales, customer retention, and platform performance. Total revenue showed strong growth in 2020, driven by enhanced loyalty program engagement, but has since plateaued. The website dominates sales contributions at 97%, while the mobile app remains underutilized, accounting for just 3% of revenue. Email and direct marketing channels are the strongest performers, collectively contributing over 80% of sales.

Customer retention remains a challenge, with repeat purchase rates declining by 10% since 2020. Loyalty customers generate higher lifetime value but exhibit higher refund rates, pointing to opportunities for program refinement. Refund trends peaked in 2020 and have since stabilized, though refunds remain higher among loyalty members.

To drive sustainable growth, ClickEdge.ai should focus on expanding its direct and email marketing channels, revitalizing its loyalty program with tiered rewards and enhanced benefits, and leveraging its affiliate network to boost high-AOV sales. Improving the mobile app experience and integrating AI-powered personalization features will increase engagement and sales across underperforming platforms. These strategies will position ClickEdge.ai for long-term success by enhancing customer satisfaction, reducing refunds, and maximizing revenue potential.

## Recommendations

Maximizing Product and Channel Performance

	1.	Expand Direct and Email Marketing Channels:
	•	Direct and Email channels drive the majority of sales (over 80%). Invest further in these channels by offering personalized campaigns, early access sales, and exclusive discounts to increase customer retention and sales conversion.
	2.	Focus on Website Optimization:
	•	With the website contributing 97% of total sales, enhance the user experience by simplifying navigation, improving search functionalities, and providing tailored recommendations. Integrating an efficient loyalty program interface can further boost engagement.
	3.	Boost AOV with Targeted Promotions:
	•	For channels with high order counts but lower AOV (e.g., social media), introduce bundle deals or limited-time offers to encourage higher spending per transaction.

 Customer Growth and Retention

	1.	Revamp Loyalty Program:
	•	The loyalty program showed strong growth in 2020 but has declined since. Introduce tiered rewards, gamification, and exclusive perks to re-engage loyalty customers. Highlight the benefits in Email and Direct marketing campaigns.
	2.	Re-engage Repeat Customers:
	•	Target repeat customers with tailored re-engagement campaigns to maintain loyalty and drive higher lifetime value. Use predictive analytics to recommend products based on past purchases.
	3.	Leverage High-AOV Channels:
	•	Invest more in Affiliate channels, which have the highest AOV. Provide affiliates with better incentives or create co-branded campaigns to maximize customer acquisition.

 Loyalty Program Enhancements

	1.	Improve Refund Rate for Loyalty Customers:
	•	Refund rates for loyalty customers are consistently higher. Focus on educating loyalty members with better product details, offering pre-purchase consultation, and implementing strict quality checks for products.
	2.	Reward Refund-Free Purchases:
	•	Incentivize loyalty members who make purchases without refunds by offering bonus points or exclusive rewards, encouraging more thoughtful purchasing and reducing refund rates.

 Optimizing Refund Management

	1.	Reduce Refund Rates in Non-Loyalty Channels:
	•	Non-loyalty customers contribute significantly to refunds. Introduce post-purchase support like free returns or exchange policies, which could improve customer satisfaction and reduce refunds.
	2.	Analyze Refund Trends:
	•	Refund rates peaked in 2020 for both loyalty and non-loyalty customers. Investigate operational or product-related causes during this period and apply preventive measures for future launches.

 Enhancing Mobile Platform Usage

	1.	Improve Mobile App Engagement:
	•	With only 3% of sales coming from the mobile app, enhance its functionality by integrating personalization features, one-click checkout, and loyalty benefits to drive app usage and sales.
	2.	Expand Social Media Advertising:
	•	Social media contributes minimally to sales. Boost its impact by running targeted campaigns with user-generated content and influencer collaborations, especially for mobile-exclusive promotions.
