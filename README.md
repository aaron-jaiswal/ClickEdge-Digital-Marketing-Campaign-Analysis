## Background

ClickEdge Digital runs 12 marketing campaigns across 10 months. Each campaign aims to attract users through online ads, with metrics captured around impressions, clicks, signups, and claims. The goal of these campaigns is to drive signups and conversions, while managing costs effectively. The company tracks detailed performance data to optimize its marketing efforts and maximize return on investment (ROI).

#### Key Metrics for Analysis

Impressions: The number of times an ad was displayed to potential customers.
Clicks: The number of times users clicked on the ad.
Signups: The number of users who signed up after clicking the ad.
CPC (Cost Per Click): The average cost the company pays for each click on the ad.
CTR (Click-Through Rate): The percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks.
Conversion Rate: The percentage of clicks that led to claims or conversions.
ROI (Return on Investment): A financial measure representing the return gained relative to the campaign cost.

## Findings 
##### ROI vs. Impressions
The scatterplot comparing ROI to impressions reveals no clear trend between these two variables. Some campaigns with lower impressions performed remarkably well in terms of ROI, while others with significantly more impressions struggled to achieve similar returns. This suggests that merely increasing impressions does not guarantee better financial outcomes, and other factors, such as campaign targeting or engagement quality, play a more substantial role in driving ROI.

##### CPC vs. CTR
The analysis of CPC against CTR reveals an unexpected disconnect between the two metrics. Campaigns with higher CPCs did not necessarily achieve better CTRs, and in some cases, they performed worse than campaigns with lower CPCs. This suggests that paying more per click doesn't always lead to higher engagement. Effective creative content or audience targeting may be more critical to improving CTR than simply increasing spending on clicks.

##### Conversion Rate Over Time
The line graph depicting conversion rates over time shows significant variability across different campaigns. Some campaigns maintained relatively stable conversion rates, while others experienced noticeable drops or fluctuations over time. This trend may indicate that factors like market saturation, campaign fatigue, or external influences (e.g., seasonality) could impact how effectively campaigns convert leads over different time periods.



## Business Recommendations

1. Focus on Campaign Quality Over Impressions: Since higher impressions do not necessarily lead to better ROI, prioritize quality audience targeting and engagement strategies over simply increasing impressions. Invest in refining campaign messaging and personalization to drive better returns.

2. Optimize Cost Per Click (CPC) Investments: Higher CPC does not guarantee better click-through rates, suggesting the need to evaluate the effectiveness of ads beyond just spending. Consider testing different ad creatives, targeting methods, and copy to boost CTR without significantly raising costs.

3. Monitor and Adapt to Conversion Rate Trends: Conversion rates vary significantly over time, so regular monitoring is essential. Investigate potential external factors like seasonality or competition and adjust campaigns accordingly. Consider refreshing ads, offers, or targeting strategies when conversion rates begin to dip to maintain consistent performance.
